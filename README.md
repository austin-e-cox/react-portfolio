# react-directory
This project utilizes React to display a web development portfolio.

## Functionality
The app has 3 pages, one for a general "about me", one for web dev portfolio data images and links, and a final oe for contact. The page is functionally simple with style being the primary driving factor of the website. It does not include any complex functionality beyond react.
We use react router to render the different pages as well as a number of components to render portions of each page. There is also a server.js file which acts as a server, enabling us to deploy to Heroku.

## Run
